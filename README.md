# React Redux Boiler Plate ðŸ”¥

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Here is two main branchs ðŸŽ‹

- [with-saga](https://github.com/iamsurajdev/react-redux-boilerplate/tree/with-saga)
- [with-thunk](https://github.com/iamsurajdev/react-redux-boilerplate/tree/with-thunk)

This is absolute boiler plate you can take this and start building your project without worrying about configuring the folder structure and basic setups like redux, redux-devtools, router etc.

Thunk is configured for the people who want to use Thunk for their async calls and same for saga if you prefer work with Saga you can choose that branch

Thank you,
Regards,
